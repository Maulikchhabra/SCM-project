                                    2) Sarthak Jain
                                    3) Krishan Rupani

-> Assigned work to the contributors : 
         1) Kshitiz Saini is requested to implement the single linked list on a different branch say b1.
         2) Krishan Rupani is requested to implement circular queue and the binary search algorithm on a branch say b2.
         3) Sarthak Jain is requested to implement queue implementation and linear search algorithm on a branch say b3.

->Advantage of Forking Workflow:

The main advantage of the Forking Workflow is that contributions can be integrated without the need for everybody to push to a single central repository. Developers push to their own server-side repositories, and only the project maintainer can push to the official repository. This allows the maintainer to accept commits from any developer without giving them write access to the official codebase.
  
  
The Forking Workflow typically follows a branching model based on the Gitflow Workflow. This means that complete feature branches will be purposed for merge into the original project maintainer's repository. The result is a distributed workflow that provides a flexible way for large, organic teams (including untrusted third-parties) to collaborate securely. This also makes it an ideal workflow for open source projects.
